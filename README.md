All players at Zporter should once a year, get a notification to run a medical screening and answer upon some medical questions in their smartphone. To do what we can and help clubs and coaches, make sure their players have the neccessary basic health to play football. 

A Medical screening form should be made available in both our Flutter apps and responsive web and saved in our Firebase BE as well as future Data lake and make available for our Big Query and AI services while anonymized for any third party users that is not a Family Member or active Coach or Team Manager, Agent etc to the Player.
